# Shiny R App for Geographic data selection and export

### Goal
Proof of concept application demonstrating:
* interaction with climr
* shiny ux proficiency
* r data import, manipulations, export

#### TODO
* gis interactions
* data layers display
* complete options controls

Following the design of https://thebeczone.ca/shiny/cciss/ but replacing lots of massive text with iconography and less and less massive text, this is meant to provide a public facing proof of proficiency in R, Shiny and applications development.
